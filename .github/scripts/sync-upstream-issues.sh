## What this issue means

Upstream moved. **This is not a known breakage.** It only means a newer
${label_name} release exists than the version this repo has explicitly
accepted in \`support/upstream-versions.json\`.

A human or agent must read the upstream release notes and verify this
repo still works against the new version. **Do not bump the accepted
version until that review is done.**

## Acceptance checklist

- [ ] Upstream release notes reviewed
- [ ] Session format: \`src/transcript/SessionFile.ts\` still accepts every entry type and message role a session written by the new release contains (\`npm run census -- --sessions <dir>\`); note any new \`CURRENT_SESSION_VERSION\`
- [ ] Extension events: every event \`src/bridge/extension.ts\` subscribes to still fires in the recorded order; re-record with \`npm run probe:live\` and diff against \`testing/fixtures/live\`
- [ ] Launch flags unchanged: \`--session-id\`, \`-e\` (see \`src/launch/prepareLaunch.ts\`)
- [ ] Existing fixtures / verification scripts still pass; regenerated fixtures documented in \`testing/fixtures/README.md\`
- [ ] \`support/upstream-versions.json\` bumped to \`${latest}\` in a PR

_Maintained automatically by \`.github/workflows/upstream-watch.yml\`. The bot keeps this issue current as upstream moves and closes it once the accepted version catches up._
